# hello-world
Hi! My name is Nick and I learn programming by myself.
Here I want to present my projects to the world. They are very simple, but I think I have to start somewhere.

I learn Python and JavaScript. There are many great programming languages out there, but I try to concentrate on these two, because I feel that you can cover a lot of ground by these two languages alone (+ some HTML and CSS).

My goal is to become a software developer/web developer.
